       "I'm a UX/UI designer based in the Bay Area. In June 2016, I graduated from the University of California, San Diego where I majored in Cognitive Science and specialized in Human-Computer Interaction. I like to solve problems using design and as such, I'm a huge proponent of user-centered design. In addition to design, I also like to dabble in front-end development. My favorite place to read up on current trends in the design industry is the <a href=\"http://usepanda.com/app/\">Use Panda app</a>.",
       "Beyond the computer screen, I have a passion for traveling, exploring new places, and collecting new experiences. I'm also a hiking enthusiast, barre workout devotee, and health-nut with an often dangerous sweet tooth."
