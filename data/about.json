       "I'm a designer based in the Bay Area. I graduated from the University of California, San Diego where I majored in Cognitive Science and specialized in Human-Computer Interaction. I like to solve problems using design and as such, I'm a huge proponent of user-centered design. In addition to design, I also like to dabble in front-end development. My favorite place to read up on current trends in the design industry is Medium.",
       "Beyond the computer screen, I have a passion for traveling, exploring new places, and collecting new experiences. I'm also a dog person, skincare enthusiast, and health-nut with an often dangerous sweet tooth.",
