    "description": "This project was centered around the theme \"How Can We Become Better Students?\". Together with my team members, we decided to address the issue of how students can quickly and easily capture all the important points of a lecture. Our solution was to build an application that allows students to add quick notes and tags to certain points of a live lecture and sync those notes to appropriate time stamps of that lecture’s podcast.",

         "First, we needed to isolate a problem existing in this space. In order to do so, we observed students in order to understand their goals, values, and come up with design insights. I went about needfinding in the lecture hall, where I observed three students during a class lecture. My observations included note-taking methodologies and habits, when students get distracted, and when they decide to pay attention again. From my observations, I asked follow-up questions to my participants and then delved into isolating user needs. Afterwards, we reconvened as a team to share our observations and agree on the issue to tackle.",
         "Together, we decided to address the issue of how traditional notes can lack context and finding a specific sound bite in a podcast is difficult. Our solution would focus on finding a way to, with little effort, create a custom podcast for yourself while listening to the lecture."

Although I’m more familiar with being the designer, it was fun and interesting to take on a role working on the server-side of an application, an aspect that I don’t normally get to work much with.",
         "As we developed our idea and built the app, sharing our progress and introducing user testing at every stage allowed us to understand whether or not our design decisions were inline with our goals for improving the the note taking experience and ultimately, the goal of leading the user to becoming a better student."

            "In terms of user testing, we conducted in-person tests with two students, as well as online A/B testing with 20 students. At this point, we had a working prototype so we could give users something tangible to use, while observing their interactions with the app.",
            "<h4 class=\"text-light sub-heading\">In-Person Tests</h4> With our in-person tests, we were curious as to how easily users could select the live lecture, add, edit, and delete a comment, and generally, navigate around the app. Overall, the biggest surprises came from the different affordances between web and mobile. Though we were developing the app on a computer, the app was meant to be used on a mobile device and as such, we tested the app on the user's mobile phone. As a result, we found that there were differences in how the app behaved and looked. While the size of the edit and delete icons were large enough when we resized the browser on the computer, they rendered too small on a mobile phone.",
            "Beyond how the app behaved on a mobile phone, we found that users interacted with the app differently since using a phone afforded different ways to perform the same action on a computer. For example, using the enter key to submit on a phone is a more common practice that clicking a button to submit. We had not taken that into consideration when we were using the app on the computer and as such, our users, who were expecting the enter key to submit their changes, were initially confused as to why it wouldn't work.",
            "In-person testing validated some design choices, while also pointing out design flaws. While it was easy for users to understand which lecture was live and navigate through the app, certain design choices, like the choice of words for a label were hard to understand.",
            "<h4 class=\"text-light sub-heading\">A/B Testing</h4> Our online A/B test was centered around how users prefer to mark a point of interest at during a lecture. Version A, the original version, allowed users to only leave comments. Version B, the experimental version, let users add tags and/or comments. By observing the number of bookmarks, edits, and deletes The overall result appears to indicate that version B, the version with tags, better guided the user into knowing what the structure of the application is and how it should be used.",
            "The qualitative analysis showed that version A users were using the application as just another form of taking notes. The comments of the version A bookmarks closely resembled text that you would continuously jot down on a notebook; this is not what we were aiming for in the design and use of the application. Version B users, on the other hand, had bookmarks with comments that were more used as titles of the tagged interval. This more so actually represented the \"bookmark\" concept we had envisioned from the get go. Therefore, the qualitative analysis seemed to indicate that version B was better in guiding the user toward the overarching function of our application PodCats.",

         "We wanted users to use PodCats as a way to mark a segment with a general topic of interest, rather than using it as a replacement note-taking tool. To accomplish this, we implemented general topic tags and a character limit. While these features had that goal in mind, there wasn't enough time to spend to ensure that users would understand and use those features with that intent.",
         "In implementing the tags later in the process, we didn't get a chance to test how well the tags were doing, namely which tags were used most, hardly, or not at all and how we could improve the types of tags that were offered. Gaining insight into which tags students found most and least useful, as well as learning what types of tags users would find most useful would've better indicated to us if we were making the right design choices for that feature.",
         "The same can be about the decision to add the character limit. While we knew how it was intended, we didn't have the time to observe and test if users understood the the purpose of the character limit was to discourage them from writing long, note-like comments and as such, it was difficult to see if that feature accomplished its goal. How it could've been improved or changed in order to do so more effectively would be a future consideration."

We got as far as implementing that functionality, but ideally that aspect of the application would’ve been expanded to involve statistics that the professor can view regarding metrics like where students are placing bookmarks and what tags students are using. We wanted to expand PodCats beyond the student population and allow for it to inform and give feedback to professors too."
