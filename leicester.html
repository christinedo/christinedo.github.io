                The goal of this project was to improve the overall usability of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141120230615/http://www.le.ac.uk/">University of Leicester's</a> website. While this entails all aspects of design, the primary focus for my team members and I was to improve the information architecture and to create an interface that supports the new categorical logic.

                <p>
                    Before diving right in, we first assessed the overall usability of the current website by way of a usability evaluation using <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Nielsen's 10 Heuristics</a>. In the process of our evaluation, we highlighted several strengths and weaknesses of the user interface that best exemplified the good and bad execution of the principles outlined by Nielsen's 10 Heuristics. This allowed us to narrow our focus to make sure we address the major usability issues apparent around Leicester's website.

                <h2 class="case-study-header">Use Cases</h2>
                <p>
                    After the usability evaluation, we started the redesign with a Google Spreadsheet. We came up with a hundred use cases for five distinct personas: Prospective Students</li> Current Students</li> Parent</li> Faculty/Staff</li> Alumni</li></ol>
                </p>
                                <p>
                    After generating the use cases, we assessed the importance, frequency, interaction cost, and page distance of each use case. Importance was generalized to each corresponding persona and measured on an subjective scale of "low", "medium", and "high". Frequency was measured on the same scale as Importance, but it took into account both the specific user and the persona. Interaction cost, rated on a scale of 1 to 5, gave an arbitrary measure of how difficult (e.g. number of clicks, visual search time, etc.) it was to complete the use case. Finally, page distance took into account the level of the website where the appropriate information was found.
                </p>
                                <p>
                    Working with use cases gave us a basic, but essential foundation for the types of users that could be found on the University of Leicester website and their goals.

                <h2 class="case-study-header">Competitive Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    The competitive analysis was a key starting point for our discussion of how exactly we were going to approach redesigning the information architecture. We examined five other university websites to get a better sense of the conventions and practices already in place. More specifically, we looked at the main navigation, user type navigation, and other main labels included on the homepage.
                </p>
                                <p>
                    Our main navigation was distilled into four main categories: About, Academics, Admissions, and Research. These labels felt like obvious choices, for one, because our data indicated that those labels were the most frequent Main Navigation labels used across the five university websites we viewed. From our use cases, we determined persona types that would be interested in information regarding general facts about the school and its academics and other personas that would be interested in research. Overall, we found that undergraduate/graduate students, parents, current students, prospective students, and professors served best to encapsulate a broader range of personas and subcategories.
                </p>
                                <p>
                    Our user type navigation included the following categories: Students, Alumni, Faculty and Staff, and Parents. These elements were, by far, the most frequently used on each of the five university websites we examined. Of note, we decided to use "Students" because it’s a broader category that can target both current and prospective students and account for the overlap between the two personas.
                </p>
                                <p>
                    In terms of other links and sections, we decided to preserve the existing "Maps and Directions", "A - Z Index", and "Blackboard" links as those were persist links and portals around the Leicester website. We also included news and events, but as two separate categories as they warranted distinction on the original Leicester website.
                </p>

                <h2 class="case-study-header">The Redesign</h2>
                <p>
                    The most significant change we made to the homepage was the navigation. In opposition to the current website, we separated the navigation from the images to create a distinction between the two so now it’s more evident that the navigation serves a role as navigation. In addition, all important and relevant links are now housed in the navigation banner. We have the main categories centered in the banner, sharing prominence with the University logo and all user links grouped in the upper left-hand corner. We moved important non-user links, such as the blackboard and A-Z Index, from the footer to the upper right hand corner for better accessibility. We’ve made it so that this navigation is pervasive throughout the website.
                </p>
                                <p>
                    Rather than just the University logo, we aimed to make the entirety of the main navigation reliable, recognizable, and straightforward. We decided to include the four categories of About, Admissions, Academics, and Research after our competitive analysis revealed the commonality of the these four categories across multiple college websites. They are also broad categories that capture a wide range of different subcategories. The same can be said about our decisions for the user type links. We found that these labels are found across many university websites and touch upon the most common users of a university website.
                </p>
                                <p>
                    Beyond the navigation, we also decided to include a News and Events section on the homepage as they are important in showcasing achievements and accomplishments. Again, we also found that these were common categories featured on the homepages of most university websites, including Leicester’s website. In our design, we separated the news from the events as we thought that they were distinct enough to warrant confusion if they are grouped. For the footer, we opted to keep it simple and moved links that we believed had more significance to the main navigation banner. Overall, we tried for a more modern look with more emphasis on navigation.

                <h2 class="case-study-header">Hardest Decisions</h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered several hard decisions over the course of our redesign. One hard decision we had to make was a decision on where to put the “Visit Us” or “Visit the Campus” link. Initially during our competitive analysis, we deemed that the “Visit Us” link was important enough to be put on both the home page as well as the about page. However, it was difficult deciding where exactly to put this link on the home page. It didn’t fit under our main navigation and we didn’t want to put it all the way in our footer. So we decided to temporarily put it in our top navigation where the user types are along with other important navigation. However, it ended up being grouped with “Maps & Directions”, “A-Z index”, and “Blackboard”. “Visit Us” just seemed wrong to be amongst those links. So in the end, we decided to just totally remove the “Visit Us” link from the home page and just keep it in the About page.
                </p>
                                <p>
                    Our next hardest decision was the designing of the home page layout. When we initially drew it out, we weren’t sure whether it was too little or too awkward since we only had a couple things we actually wanted on our homepage: the navigation bar, the news carousel, list of news, list of events, and the footer. This led us to our next decision: whether or not news and events should be separated or combined. We felt that there would be too little information if we didn’t separate them, and some users would find it more useful if they were separated. We also analyzed other college websites to see how their home pages looked like. In the end, we decided to separate the news and events section into two separate sections which helped our homepage look a bit more full.
                </p>
                                <p>
                    This led to the decision of whether or not the events section of the page should be listed vertically or horizontally. At first we wanted it to be vertical because it was usually vertical on other university sites. But all of our content tended to be oriented horizontally. So we tried to make it work listing the events horizontally.
                </p>
                                <p>
                    Another hard decision was whether or not to include a “Library” link in any of the top-level navigation bars. It was important enough for Leicester to include it in the same navbar as Staff, Current Students, and Blackboard, but unimportant enough that this navbar was located in the footer. We didn’t think that Library belonged in the same row as Staff and Students, or any of the other top-level navbars, and it didn’t really fit in any of the secondary subcategories either. We came to the decision of cutting it from the homepage entirely and instead placing it under Academic Resources & Support under Students.
