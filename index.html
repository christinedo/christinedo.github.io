    <h1>Podcats</h1>
        <h4>How Can We Become Better Students?</h4>
            <h2>Background</h2>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">PodCats is a non-native application that seeks to augment the note taking process, giving students the ability to add context directly to the class lectures. It takes advantage of the UC San Diego podcasting system, allowing users to tag key segments of a live lecture for archival review in its podcast form.</p>

            <h3>Needfinding</h3>
            <h5>Observe People, Find Need(s)</h5>
                <p>Needfinding in week 2 allowed us to freely (and individually) interpret the studio brief. It forced us to focus on a specific aspect of what it means to be a student and explore issues stemming from that focus. When we came together, it gave our group a narrower focus of note taking.

            <h3>Storyboards<br/> &amp; Paper Prototypes</h3>
            <h5>Don't sweat the pixels</h5>
                <p>Storyboarding gave us the chance to take realistic approach to the design of our app. It allowed us to think about situations in which our idea would be helpful to students and how they would realistically use it. We also thought about how, if, and when we would use our own application. Moving forward, paper prototyping was a process that let us try out initial designs that would be both fun and useful for students.

            <h3>Heuristic Evalulation</h3>
            <h5>With Nielsen's 10 Heuristics</h5>
                <p>The heuristic evaluation was an exercising in giving and receiving feedback. From feedback, we were able to understand the significance of the feedback we received. In receiving feedback, we were able to compare our vision of the prototypes with how other students perceived the usability of our designs. Overall, this has allowed us to take a step back and re-evaluate how and if our designs help or hinder our goals for how students will use the application to learn and take notes. It isolated clear strong and weak points and aided in the iteration of our current version of PodCats.

            <h2>Background</h2>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">The goal of this project was to gain experience with the practical side of working with a client. Over the course of 10 weeks, my team members and I worked on branding, designing, and implementing a website for our client, Muir Woods Coffee House (Muir Woods for short). We worked closely with Justin, the Director of Muir Woods Coffee House, through out the duration of the project.</p>

                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">Much like other students, my prior experiences with Muir Woods all involved coffee, small talk with a "Muirista" (Muir Woods barista), and then settling into a couch to do work. It was useful to have familiarity with Muir Woods, but in order to succeed, I knew that I had to transcend my position as a customer.</p>
            <h3>Client Survey</h3>
            <h5>Laying out the initial groundwork</h5>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">To get a little more perspective, we sat down with Justin for an initial interview about the background of Muir Woods, user demographics, and his vision for the website. After the interview, we sat down to compile and analyze his responses. From there, we abstracted and documented initial design ideas for the website.</p>

                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">Overall, we found one central theme: Muir Woods is more than just the coffee; it's the people that work, study, and hang out in the space that is Muir Woods. Justin emphasized that his ideal website would be:</p>
                <div class="logistics">
                    <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Comfortable</strong> - The user shouldn't feel sold to</li>
                        <li><strong>Familiar</strong> - Let the user get to know more about Muir Woods </li>
                        <li><strong>Engaging</strong> - Let the personality of the website engage the user</li>
                    </ul>
                    </blockquote>
                </div>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">With that in mind, we knew we shouldn't embrace the traditional model of retail-oriented sites.</p>

                <a href="documents/mwch/ClientSurvey.pdf"><button>View Client Survey (PDF)</button></a>
            <h2>The User</h2>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">From our initial interview with the client, we garnered that the user group we should be targeting for the website are UCSD students. As students ourselves, we already had some ideas of what we thought should be included on the website. But every user is different and conducting user interviews gave us a greater perspective about how others would use the website.</p>
            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <h5>In which we ask way too many questions about coffee</h5>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">We interviewed a total of 9 users and broke down our questions based on their prior experience with Muir Woods. Every interviewee answered a set of general interview questions that targeted what they expected from any coffee shop and a set of questions after a similar website walkthrough. For the walkthrough, we chose a well-known, clearly branded, business and retail-oriented coffee company. By going to the other extreme, we thought it would be useful to see what big companies do well and what they didn't. With that knowledge, we could really focus on the advantages of a smaller, community coffee shop like Muir Woods.</p>

                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">From there, we diverged into two sets of specific interview questions. For interviewees who have never been to Muir Woods, we had them answer interview questions for potential customers. These questions were generalized to any coffee shop, but we asked them more specifically about their behaviors and preferences in regards to their prior experiences in other coffee shops. For interviewees who have been to Muir Woods, we asked them specfically about Muir Woods—their impressions, their experiences, why Muir Woods, etc.</p>

                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">After consolidating our data, we broke down our main user groups as follows:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <ol class="orderedList">
                        <li>Potential UCSD Student Customers (On and Off Campus)</li>
                        <li>Off-Campus UCSD Student Continuing/Past Customers</li>
                        <li>On-Campus UCSD Student Continuing/Past Customers</li>
                    </ol>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">We created 3 user personas from our main user groups and created user scenarios and use cases for each persona.</p>

            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">For our competitve analysis, we looked at 5 competitor websites, ranging from well-known companies to lesser known shops, and highlighted the positives and negatives of each website's brand, functionality, content, site architecture, navigation, and design. Through our analysis, we came to form the initial framework of our website design for Muir Woods by comparing the contents of competitor sites with the wishes, wants, and needs of our client. Our findings included concrete ideas about what the website needs or doesn't need, as well as some initial thoughts into the aesthetics.</p>
            <h2>Creative Brief</h2>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">At this point in the process, we had to sit down and layout exactly what we wanted in terms of navigation, brand, information architecture, and layout/design. Our direction for the website was documented in a creative brief, which gave the client a better understanding of what to expect from the final website, along with some potential challenges that we were likely to encounter moving forward.</p>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">In terms of navigation and information architecture, we decided upon four main sections of the website:</p>
                <div class="logistics">
                    <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>About</strong> - 3 subpages: "Background &amp; Mission Statement", "Meet the Muiristas", and "Where We Source From"</li>
                        <li><strong>Menu</strong> - Lists products and prices; Chalkboard themed </li>
                        <li><strong>Stories</strong> - A request of the client; A sort-of "testimonials" page</li>
                        <li><strong>Gallery</strong> - High quality photos of daily life at Muir Woods</li>
                    </ul>
                    </blockquote>
                </div>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">In terms of personality and tone, it was clear to us that the website had to feel <strong>comfortable and personable</strong>. This was not only something the client expressed, but it was also evident to us that our user interviewees felt that that was the essence of Muir Woods.</p>

            <h2>Opening the Toolbox</h2>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">The wireframes were created collaboratively with Axure, the mockups by yours truly with Sketch.</p>
            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <h5>Harnessing the power of dynamic panels</h5>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">Axure enabled us to generate HTML files of our wireframes, allowing us to dynamically showcase some interactivity of the design. Also included in the wireframes are blue notes on the functional specifications of interactive components of our website and as such, they should not be regarded as part of the design.</p>
                <a href="/mwch-wireframe"><button>View Wireframes</button></a>
            <h3>Mockups</h3>
            <h5>Insert pretty pictures here</h5>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">After feedback and careful consideration, we made some changes to the design and layout of the website. One of the most significant and noticeable changes was our decision to <span>combine all subpages under a category into one page</span>. That is, we combined all the subpages under "About" into one page, and all the subpages under "Menu" into one menu.</p>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">We noted that combining the About pages into one page would make the page quite long. That meant that the current style of the navigation bar (static, with a tall height) also had to change. I was tasked with creating mockups for the pages in the website, as well as figuring out the design of the new About page, Menu page, and navigation bar.</p>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">Initially, we were worried about lengthy submissions which would disengage the audience. Our solution to this potential issue was to institute a 250 character limit on the length of the stories users can submit. In this way, we can ensure some limitations on length while also encouraging users to concisely articulate their thoughts and opinions.</p>
                <div class="mockups">
                    <img src="froont-page/images/mwch-home.png">
                    <img src="froont-page/images/mwch-about.png">
                    <img src="froont-page/images/mwch-menu.png">
                    <img src="froont-page/images/mwch-stories.png">
                    <img src="froont-page/images/mwch-gallery.png">
                </div> 
            <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">In the interim period between the mockups and the implementation of the final prototype, we went through a many design changes and tweaks. Albeit small in nature, they made a noticeable difference.</p>
                <!-- <p>In execution, the light font weight and white overlay in some image backgrounds did not render as visible on other screens as it did on the mockups. I decided to revert the font weight back to the normal value and inverted the constrast on the image overlay and the text on top of it.</p> -->
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">The Google Map has long been a placeholder as we reasoned that UCSD students, our target users, would not find it as helpful since Muir Woods is located directly on campus. The initial idea was to create our own map—a simple, still graphic—that would use the surrounding buildings as local landmarks. But since Muir Woods is located underneath another building, our graphical representations seemed too abstract. In the end, we decided on a photo of the storefront, which we believed was the most informative when paired with the text directions on the right.</p>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">We also replaced placeholder images with photos that showed off the more humanistic aspects of Muir Woods and the day-to-day happenings at Muir Woods. For example, whereas the original header image was more focused on the machine, we replaced it with a photo of a Muirista preparing a drink from the vantage point of an ordering customer.</p>

            <h2>The Problem With<br/>Ten Weeks</h2>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">The problem, of course, is that it's still not enough time. In reflection, I would’ve liked to devote more time developing the brand further by using more graphics, photos, and animations/interactive effects to improve the overall flow of the website. There had to be a lot of compromise between our goals for the final prototype and what's reasonable within our timeframe with our abilities, but moving forward, I would like to explore, develop, and refine the asthetics (perhaps revisiting chalkboard influences) and on the development side, optimize the website to be responsive.</p>

    <h1>Redesign: University of Leicester</h1>
        <h4>Structure &amp; Form: Usability &amp; Information Architecture</h4>
            <h2>Background</h2>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">The goal of this project was to improve the overall usability of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141120230615/http://www.le.ac.uk/">University of Leicester's</a> website. While this entails all aspects of design, the primary focus was on improving the information architecture to make logical sense and on creating an interface to support the new categorical logic. This redesign was undertaken over the course of two weeks in November 2014 and as such, a complete redesign was not possible in the given timeframe.</p>
            <h3>In the details</h3>
            <h5>Some Project Logistics</h5>

            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <h3>Usability Evaluation</h3>
            <h5>Using Nielsen's 10 Heuristics</h5>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">Before diving right in, we first assessed the overall usability of the current website by way of a usability evaluation using <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Nielsen's 10 Heuristics</a>. In the process of our evaluation, we highlighted several strengths and weaknesses of the user interface that best exemplified the good and bad execution of the principles outlined by Nielsen's 10 Heuristics. This allowed us to narrow our focus to make sure we address the major usability issues apparent around Leicester's website. served as starting point for our redesign.</p>
                <a href="/leicester-usability-evaluation/"><button>View Usability Evaluation</button></a>
            <h3>Use Cases</h3>
            <h5>All 100 of them</h5>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">After the usability evaluation, we started the redesign not with a text editor, but with a Google Spreadsheet. We came up with a total of exactly 100 use cases for five distinct personas:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <ol class="orderedList">
                        <li>Prospective student</li>
                        <li>Current Student</li>
                        <li>Parent</li>
                        <li>Faculty/Staff</li>
                        <li>Alumni</li>
                    </ol>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">After generating the use cases, we assessed the importance, frequency, interaction cost, and page distance of each use case. Importance was generalized to each corresponding persona and measured on an subjective scale of "low", "medium", and "high". Frequency was measured on the same scale as Importance, but it took into account both the specific user and the persona. Interaction cost, rated on a scale of 1 to 5, gave an arbitrary measure of how difficult (e.g. number of clicks, visual search time, etc.) it was to complete the use case. Finally, page distance took into account the level of the website where the appropriate information was found.</p>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">Working with use cases gave us a basic but essential foundation for the types of users that could be found on the University of Leicester website and their goals.</p>
            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <h5>College Edition</h5>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">The competitive analysis was a key starting point for our discussion of how exactly we were going to approach redesigning the information architecture. We examined five other university websites to get a better sense of the conventions and practices already used and in place. More specifically, we looked at the main navigation, user type navigation, and other main labels included on the homepage.</p>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">Our main navigation was distilled into four main categories:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <ol class="orderedList">
                        <li>About</li>
                        <li>Academics</li>
                        <li>Admissions</li>
                        <li>Research</li>
                    </ol>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">These labels felt like obvious choices, for one, because our data indicated that those labels were the most frequent Main Navigation labels used across the five university websites we viewed. From our use cases, we determined many persona types that would be interested in information regarding general facts about the school and its academics, such as potential undergraduate and graduate students and parents, and other personas that would be interested in research, such as current students, prospective students, and even professors. Overall, these four main labels serve best to encapsulate a broader range of personas and subcategories.</p>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">Our user type navigation included the following categories:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <ol class="orderedList">
                        <li>Students</li>
                        <li>Alumni</li>
                        <li>Parents</li>
                        <li>Faculty and Staff</li>
                    </ol>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">These elements were, by far, the most frequently used on each of the five university websites we examined. Of note, we decided to use "Students" because it’s a broader category that can target both current and prospective students and account for the overlap between the two personas.</p>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">In terms of other links and sections, we decided to perserve the existing "Maps and Directions", "A - Z Index", and "Blackboard" links. We also included news and events, but as two separate categories as they warranted distinction on the original Leicester website.</p>
            <h2>The Redesign</h2>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">The most significant change we made to the homepage was the navigation. In opposition to the current website, we separated the navigation from the images to create a distinction between the two so now it’s more evident that the navigation serves a role as navigation. In addition, all important and relevant links are now housed in the navigation banner. We have the main categories centered in the banner, sharing prominence with the University logo and all user links grouped in the upper left-hand corner. We moved important non-user links, such as the blackboard and A-Z Index, from the footer to the upper right hand corner for better accessibility. We’ve made it so that this navigation is pervasive throughout the website.</p> 
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">Rather than just the University logo, we aimed to make the entirety of the main navigation reliable, recognizable, and straightforward. We decided to include the four categories of About, Admissions, Academics, and Research after our competitive analysis revealed the commonality of the these four categories across multiple websites. They are also broad categories that capture a wide range of different subcategories. The same can be said about our decisions for the user type links. We found that these labels are found across many university websites and touch upon the most common users of a university website.</p> 
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">Beyond the navigation, we also decided to include a News and Events section on the homepage as they are important in showcasing achievements and accomplishments. Again, we also found that these were common categories featured on the homepages of most university websites, including Leicester’s website. In our design, we separated the news from the events as we thought that they were distinct enough to warrant confusion if they are grouped. For the footer, we opted to keep it simple and moved links that we believed had more significance to the main navigation banner. Overall, we tried for a more modern look with more emphasis on navigation.</p>
                <a href="/leicester-redesign"><button>View Website</button></a>
            <h2>Thoughts for<br/>a second chance</h2>
                <p class="portfolio-paragraph">Given more time, I would've like to revisit the layout of the website. With the two week time frame and the central focus on the information architecture and the navigation, there are many gaps in the consistency and design of the asthetics. Of note, the second level pages look and feel a bit disconnected from the homepage, which boasts more photos and a more cohensive look from top to bottom. The navigational elements of the second level pages could also use more improvement. Looking back, I think we might've made the categories too few in number as there is a lot of information that we did not account for. My thoughts for a second chance: Revisit the information architecture of the second level pages and reassess the design and layout of the website.</p>
