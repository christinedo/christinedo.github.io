                    In our group evaluation of the usability of the <a href="http://www.le.ac.uk/"> University of Leicester</a>, we examined all aspects, both positive and negative, of the University of Leicester’s website. In the process of our evaluation, we highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of the user interface we thought best exemplifies good and bad execution of the principles outlined by <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Nielsen's Ten Heuristics</a>. This is the result of our assessment- our report on the usability of the University of Leicester as outlined by Nielsen’s "10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design".

                    <h3>1. Visibility of system status</h3>
                    Whether it is through the user interface or the syntax on the webpage, it is important to appropriately and accurately communicate to the user where they are in the grand scheme of the website- especially for a site as large as a university’s. In keeping the user informed, you improve their user experience by making it easier for them to accomplish their goals. <br><br>
                    <div class = "screenshots">
                        <a class="vlightbox0" href="img/crumbH1.png"><img src="img/crumbH1.png" alt = "x"></a>
                    </div>
                    When the user digs deep enough in the subpages, a "trail of breadcrumbs" appear below the main title. It tells the user what page they are currently at and how they got there if they ever want to trail backwards. However, the bread crumbs are small in comparison to the two title headers it's squished between that a user typically wouldn't look there.<br><br>
                    The user would be drawn more towards the headers "School of Modern Languages" and "Upcoming Events". This is both a good thing and a bad thing as the headers successfully let the user know where they are currently, but distracts the user from seeing the trail of breadcrumbs.<br><br><br><br>
                    
                    <div class = "screenshots">
                        <a class="vlightbox0" href="img/globalH1.png"><img src="img/globalH1.png" alt = "x"></a>
                    </div>
                    The global navigation always keeps the user in the know. Should the user ever get lost, they'll always know how to get to the Home, University A-Z, and Maps and Directions. Although, the links provided in the global navigation aren't exactly the most useful, it gives the user some feeling of stability.<br><br> 
                    The site is trying to communicate that if we ever need to go somewhere else, we can always go back home, find what we want in a huge alphabetical list, or look at the campus map!
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    
                    <div class = "screenshots">
                        <a class="vlightbox0" href="img/azH1.png"><img src="img/azH1.png" alt = "x"></a>
                    </div>
                    Clicking on the "University A-Z" link gives us a page with the large title header "Academic Departments A-Z". Wait... I thought we clicked on "University A-Z"? Shouldn't the header be the same as what I clicked on?<br><br>
                    This confuses the user to question whether or not they clicked on the correct link or not. Seeing the link "University A-Z", one would think that would encompass everything on the University site in alphabetical order, not just the Academic Departments. So, "Complete A-Z" would've been more logical to start with after clicking on "University A-Z" than starting on "Academic Departments A-Z" . 
                    
                </div>

                <div class= "heuristics" id = "heuristic-2">
                    <h3>2. Match between system and the real world</h3>
                    In the words of Nielsen, “The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.”
<br><br>
                    <div class = "screenshots">
                        <a class="vlightbox0" href="img/cpdH2.png"><img src="img/cpdH2.png" alt = "x"></a>
                    </div>
                    Briefly looking through the Home page, one would expect to understand most things that appear on the Home page since it's the page most users would start off with. A Home page shouldn't have any technical terms as that would deter a user from diving in any deeper, or in some cases, intrigue a user to find out what that technical term means.<br><br>In this case, clicking on the "Business and Enterprise" category gives us a speech bubble with some subcategories including one that says "CPD: professional development and training". The typical user would have no idea what CPD means. One can infer that "PD" means "professional development" but what about the "C"?? Click on it and find out, but that would take an extra click!
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    
                    <div class = "screenshots">

                    </div>
                    Going to the Leicester's "About" page we see yet another technical word most users wouldn't know about. "A belief that teaching and research are synergistic". What exactly is "synergistic"? No one knows.<br><br>
                    Under their discoveries, we see very general links like "Black holes" and "Richard III". Although this does intrigue the user, but it may cause misunderstanding like "Leicester was the one who discovered and defined what a black hole is??"<br><br>

                </div>
                
            <!-- **************************  HEURISTIC 3  ************************** -->
                
                <div class= "heuristics" id = "heuristic-3">
                    <h3>3. User control and freedom</h3>
                    As Nielsen aptly put it, “Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked ‘emergency exit’ to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue”. Giving the user autonomy for certain aspects and functions of your site goes a long way in reducing their frustrations and proportionally, improving their experience. 
<br><br><br><br>
                    <div class = "screenshots">
                        <a class="vlightbox0" href="img/flashH3.png"><img src="img/flashH3.png" alt = "x"></a>
                    </div>
                    There's a nasty flash player in the University Library's home page. It takes awhile to load the flash player and once it finally does load, the slideshow autoloops. The slideshow looks like an ad totally unrelated to the University when it really is just telling the user what the library has to offer. If the user wants to change to see what's next, the flash player takes an absurd amount of time to actually change to the picture you want to see. Users just want quick access to see what's offered, but this flash player doesn't give that option. 
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    
                    <div class = "screenshots">
                        <a class="vlightbox0" href="img/sliderH3.png"><img src="img/sliderH3.png" alt = "x"></a>
                    </div>
                    Leicester did good with this nice Lightbox-like slideshow in the "Study with us" page. Although it autoloops, it allows the user to click next or previous or even click on the boxes on the top right to go to the exact picture you want to see. Clicking on a particular box, the slideshow pauses for a good amount of time before autolooping once more. This pause is nice in that it allows the user to take in all the information they wanted to see. One downside is that there's no option to actually stop the slideshow from autolooping. 
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    
                    <div class = "screenshots">

                    </div>
                    The slider on the home page is excellent in that it doesn't autoloop through all of "What's happening?". It allows the user to optionally click the next and previous arrows to look through them if they ever so please.<br><br>
                    There's also enough indication that it's a slider with the prominent arrow icons. The slider also has a good amount of visuals and descriptions to inform a user of what is "behind the fold" of each of the "What's happening?"
                    
                </div>

                <div class= "heuristics" id = "heuristic-4">
                    <h3>4. Consistency and standards</h3>
                    As users become accustomed to the ways of the website, they find it faster and easier to use, never having to anticipate the functions of a button or the look of a web page. Which is why consistency is key for any website. Abrupt changes in style and function causes confusion, frustration, and unnecessarily lengthy interactions.<br><br>
                    <div class = "screenshots">
                        <a class="vlightbox0" href="img/headerH4.png"><img src="img/headerH4.png" alt = "x"></a>
                    </div>
                    A user visiting the University of Leicester website can count on the logo, global navigation, and search bar to be in the same positions at the top of pages throughout much of the site. The university’s logo can almost always be found in the upper left-hand corner. On the opposite side, the search bar lies in the upper right hand corner.<br><br> 
                    Underneath the logo and the search bar is the global navigation. This is layout is found to be true for the majority of pages on the website. Granted, there are some irregularities in the UI of the header, which is in part due to the domain the website is hosted on. Pages hosted on www.le.ac.uk are mixed with pages hosted on www2.le.ac.uk, which can cause confusion when externally linking to these webpages. Nonetheless, the logo, global navigation, and the search bar all serve the same functionalities and actions regardless of the UI or domain.<br><br><br><br>
                    
                    <div class = "screenshots">
                        <a class="vlightbox0" href="img/layoutH4.png"><img src="img/layoutH4.png" alt = "x"></a>
                    </div>
                    Navigating to different pages and topics in the University of Leicester’s website felt like navigating through a bunch of different websites at an instantaneous rate. The most glaring fault of Leicester’s website is its lack of unity when it came to the styles of its pages. Different pages have different layouts, color schemes, and font stylings. <br><br> 
                    Even for pages that have the same layout, there is a drastic shift in background color from page to page (e.g. Legal vs. Help). Comparing the Alumni, Research, and A-Z Index pages, there is an evident disparity in the layout of the pages. The style of the Research page looks decidedly more glossy than the plain text and colors of the A-Z Index page or even the Alumni page. And the A-Z Index page features breadcrumbs while the Alumni and Research pages do not. Although the same font (Arial) is used throughout the website, the stylings of the header, text, links, etc. are evidently different.
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    
                    <div class = "screenshots">
                        <a class="vlightbox0" href="img/navigationH4.png"><img src="img/navigationH4.png" alt = "x"></a>
                    </div>
                    While the global navigation of the website is found to be constant, the same cannot be said about the secondary navigation on the University of Leicester’s website. <br><br>
                    On pages like the Research and Alumni page (shown), the navigation is on top, above the main content. On pages in Business Services, there is a left navigation bar. Conversely, right navigation bars are used on pages like About Us and A-Z Index.
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    
                    <div class = "screenshots">
                        <a class="vlightbox0" href="img/searchlogoH4.png"><img src="img/searchlogoH4.png" alt = "x"></a>
                    </div>
                    When the user uses the search function on University of Leicester’s website, there are redirected to a page of results from Google Search Appliance- any semblance of Leicester’s website is literally blank. The only thing to signify that this search function is related to the University of Leicester is the logo in the upper left hand corner- exactly where one would expect it to be. One would also expect that clicking the logo would lead to the homepage. But clicking the logo on the search results page instead loads as a blank search results page.<br><br>
                    A user used to the homepage-linking function of the logo would most certainly feel surprised and annoyed. Since there is a lack of navigation on the search page, to go back to the homepage while still remaining in the page, the user would have to search for the homepage and click a search result- an unconventional method.

                <div class= "heuristics" id = "heuristic-5">
                    <h3>5. Error prevention</h3>
                    An element of human error is inevitable for most situations. Nielsen points out that, “Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place”. In that sense, the ability to detect possible errors before or while they occur is even more valuable to a user than informing them after the error has already been submitted for approval. 
<br><br>
                    <div class = "screenshots">
                        <a class="vlightbox0" href="img/donateH5.png"><img src="img/donateH5.png" alt = "x"></a>
                    </div>
                    For the most part, the University of Leicester does a good job of notifying the user of errors, but only after they have occurred. The Donate Online form indicates to users that there are errors in the input by firstly notifying them with an error alert message in yellow. But overall, the message is too small and not colorful enough to compete against the red boxes highlighting where in the form the error occurred. <br><br> 
                    The box is very noticeable and and the red color is a typical indicator of something bad or alarming. It can be assumed then, that the red squares next to some fields are used to designate something to take note of. But for the user filling out the form, there is nothing explicitly stating that the small red square means that it is required. That certain error of user negligence can be prevented by explicitly stating beforehand that the red square means that it is required.<br><br><br><br>
                    
                    <div class = "screenshots">

                    </div>
                    The prospectus student form shares a lot of the same qualities as that of the Donate Online form. There is a lack of explicit indication to the user beforehand that certain fields are mandatory and there is no validation of correct or incorrect input (e.g. typing in the right form of an email address) until after the user tries to submit information. Only after submission do error messages appear and incorrect inputs are highlighted.

                    <h3>6. Recognition rather than recall</h3>
                    Recognition and recall each have their appropriate situations. The ability to recall information for an exam could arguably be more useful in the long run than the ability to recognize an answer as correct. In terms of a website, it is more appropriate for users to use their recognition of objects and their functionality in order to facilitate a smooth, easy, and stress-free user experience.<br><br>

                    Breadcrumbs are an important feature to include for a website with an extensive site map like the University of Leicester’s. Leicester provides, on most sub-level pages, breadcrumbs as a means for a user to know where they are and where they have been. Also keeping in mind the inconsistencies of the site, breadcrumbs are especially valuable to a user on the University of Leicester’s website where it is especially easy to get confused by the disparities in form and function. <br><br><br><br>
                    
                    <div class = "screenshots">

                    Your best friend on the University of Leicester’s website is the university’s logo. It is the most consistent aspect of Leicester’s website. More often than not, it is right where you expect it to be, in the same orange color, and it will lead you back to the homepage if you are lost. As a user, you come to depend on it a lot since you know where it will lead you. The logo aside however, the different page layouts and color schemes do not help a user visually recognize aspects of the site as coming from the same source. Overall, it is hard to identify and recognize a brand for the University of Leicester.

                    <h3>7. Flexibility and efficiency of use</h3>
                    Novice users, expert users, and the users in between, all differ in levels of understanding about a website. Keeping mind the range of users that your website could attract, you should always aim to make your intentions about the content of your website understandable and accessible to users of all expert levels.<br><br>
                    <div class = "screenshots">
                        <a class="vlightbox0" href="img/homeH7.png"><img src="img/homeH7.png" alt = "x"></a>
                    </div>
                    Navigating this website is very inefficient. There is a glaring lack of global navigation, especially from the home page, which turns getting to a specific page into an exercise of finding ability. The home page is particularly bad in that the nav bar itself does not link anywhere, but instead cycles the header to a different section.<br><br>
                    While this looks kind of nice, it makes it so that navigating to a wanted section takes two clicks that are rather far apart, which is especially annoying if you've used the site before and just want to get somewhere.

                    <div class = "screenshots">

                    </div>
                    The site's search feature is powered by Google, which is good in that the results are guaranteed to have been obtained through good SEO. One big problem though is the way that the "Key Match" feature is implemented. Searching for a keyword like "Library" makes the best match get displayed at the top with a light blue background.<br><br> The problem with that is that it looks like what an ad would normally look like, and the user is very likely to gloss over it entirely. To make matters worse, the word "Library" is not bolded in the Key Match like it is in the other search results.

                <div class= "heuristics" id = "heuristic-8">
                    <h3>8. Aesthetic and minimalist design</h3>
                    Clutter, the extraneous and excessive elements of a website, is largely unwelcome because it usually impedes the user's ability to navigate the site and detracts from the accomplishment of end-goals. In that sense, a minimalist design is appreciated for its ability to showcase the relevant elements. <br><br>
                    <div class = "screenshots">
                        <a class="vlightbox0" href="img/staffH8.png"><img src="img/staffH8.png" alt = "x"></a>
                    </div>
                    The staff page is a perfect example of how too many elements can destroy a page's readability. I hesitate to call the left half of the screen a sidebar, as it is far too wide and far too cluttered. There is no reason it couldn't be half the width that it is, the only element preventing that is the unnecessary picture. The clutter of the sidebar hurts not only its own readability, but also the readability of the rest of the page. Reading the announcements and latest news is physically painful with the amount of distractions coming from the left half of the screen. On top of everything, the layout decision of having the page split in half just looks incredibly unappealing on its own.

                    <div class = "screenshots">

                    </div>
                    The "Read More" buttons implemented on the various blog and news posts actually do their job relatively well, if a little textbook. The blog/news home pages contain a list of headers, each of which has a Read More button that takes you to the article's own page. The only problem with this implementation is that the descriptions of the articles are far too short.<br><br>
                    In the example here, absolutely no information about the event is given other than the date and location, despite the staggering amount of information in the article itself. It would be very useful to have at least a summary. The small descriptions also cause the awkward cases of the Read More button taking up as much as half of the height of the article.

                    <h3>9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</h3>
                    "Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution." -Nielsen on Heuristic #9<br><br>
                    <div class = "screenshots">
                        <a class="vlightbox0" href="img/old404H9.png"><img src="img/old404H9.png" alt = "x"></a>
                    </div>
                    For some reason, while most of the pages on this website are hosted on www2.le.ac.uk, some are hosted on www.le.ac.uk. The two servers have different 404 error pages, and the one for www is really bad.<br><br>
                    The only help the page gives is links to navigate away from it. Of the three links in the body of the page, two are redundant with the footer and one no longer exists and thus ironically links back to the 404 page.

                    <div class = "screenshots">

                    </div>
                    The www2 404 page on the other hand is pretty helpful. It keeps the general format of the rest of the website (logo search and nav bar at the top, footer at the bottom) which allows the user to easily navigate away. In addition, the body of the page actually provides suggestions for what the user may have been looking for, as well as a link to contact the website administrator.<br><br><br><br>

                    <h3>10. Help and documentation</h3>
                    Needed or not, help and documentation has come to be expected on websites. Pages such as the FAQ, copyright information, and the privacy policy are largely overlooked by most users, but when they are needed it is expected that they are, suffice to say, clear and actually helpful. <br><br>
                    <div class = "screenshots">
                        <a class="vlightbox0" href="img/helpH10.png"><img src="img/helpH10.png" alt = "x"></a>
                    </div>
                    The university's dedicated help page does its job fairly well. It divides the potential areas of help into eight categories that are more or less mutually exclusive, which significantly narrows down the number of links that the user would need to look through. However, the category headers not much bigger than the actual links, and the page as a whole essentially amounts to a list of links, as there are no separators between the different categories. The entire page is just text.<br><br><br><br>
                    
                    <div class = "screenshots">
                        <a class="vlightbox0" href="img/legalH10.png"><img src="img/legalH10.png" alt = "x"></a>
                    </div>
                    In the site footer, there is a link to "Legal" and a link to "Privacy & Cookies", but they both link to the Copyright page in the Legal section. It appears that the "Privacy & Cookies" link is actually broken as it points to the www version of the page rather than the www2 version. However, even if the link worked, it's confusing that Privacy Policy and Cookies are two separate pages, when the link claims that it's linking to both.<br><br><br><br>
                    
                    <div class = "screenshots">

                    </div>
					The help section on the map is actually very helpful. It gives instructions on how to use the various features the map has to offer, and has easy to access directions via whatever method of transport the user chooses. The help display pops up automatically whenever you open the map page, and how to close it and open it back up again is very visually apparent. The fact that it pops up when you open the page is very useful when it's your first time doing so, but it could get annoying having to close the display every time when you already know how to use it.<br><br><br>
