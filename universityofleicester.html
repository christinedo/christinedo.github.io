                          While this entails all aspects of design, the primary focus for my team members and I was on improving the information architecture to make logical sense and on creating an interface to support the new categorical logic.</p>

                        <p>Before diving right in, we first assessed the overall usability of the current website by way of a usability evaluation using <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Nielsen's 10 Heuristics</a>.
                          In the process of our evaluation, we highlighted several strengths and weaknesses of the user interface that best exemplified the good and bad execution of the principles outlined by Nielsen's 10 Heuristics.
                          This allowed us to narrow our focus to make sure we address the major usability issues apparent around Leicester's website.</p>

                        <p>
                          After the usability evaluation, we started the redesign not with a text editor, but with a Google Spreadsheet.
                          We came up with a total of exactly 100 use cases for five distinct personas: Prospective Students, Current Students, Parent, Faculty/Staff, Alumni.
                        </p>
                        <p>After generating the use cases, we assessed the importance, frequency, interaction cost, and page distance of each use case.
                          Importance was generalized to each corresponding persona and measured on an subjective scale of "low", "medium", and â€œhigh".
                          Frequency was measured on the same scale as Importance, but it took into account both the specific user and the persona.
                          Interaction cost, rated on a scale of 1 to 5, gave an arbitrary measure of how difficult (e.g. number of clicks, visual search time, etc.) it was to complete the use case.
                          Finally, page distance took into account the level of the website where the appropriate information was found.</p>
                        <p>
                          Working with use cases gave us a basic, but essential foundation for the types of users that could be found on the University of Leicester website and their goals.

                        The competitive analysis was a key starting point for our discussion of how exactly we were going to approach redesigning the information architecture.
                        We examined five other university websites to get a better sense of the conventions and practices already in place.
                        More specifically, we looked at the main navigation, user type navigation, and other main labels included on the homepage.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Our main navigation was distilled into four main categories: About, Academics, Admissions, and Research.
                        These labels felt like obvious choices, for one, because our data indicated that those labels were the most frequent Main Navigation labels used across the five university websites we viewed.
                        From our use cases, we determined persona types that would be interested in information regarding general facts about the school and its academics and other personas that would be interested in research.
                        Overall, we found that undergraduate/graduate students, parents, current students, prospective students, and professors served best to encapsulate a broader range of personas and subcategories.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Our user type navigation included the following categories: Students, Alumni, Faculty and Staff, and Parents.
                        These elements were, by far, the most frequently used on each of the five university websites we examined.
                        Of note, we decided to use "Students" because itâ€™s a broader category that can target both current and prospective students and account for the overlap between the two personas.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In terms of other links and sections, we decided to preserve the existing "Maps and Directions", "A - Z Index", and "Blackboard" links.
                        We also included news and events, but as two separate categories as they warranted distinction on the original Leicester website.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div class="fr-text">
                        <p>The most significant change we made to the homepage was the navigation.
                          In opposition to the current website, we separated the navigation from the images to create a distinction between the two so now itâ€™s more evident that the navigation serves a role as navigation.
                          In addition, all important and relevant links are now housed in the navigation banner.
                          We have the main categories centered in the banner, sharing prominence with the University logo and all user links grouped in the upper left-hand corner.
                          We moved important non-user links, such as the blackboard and A-Z Index, from the footer to the upper right hand corner for better accessibility.
                          Weâ€™ve made it so that this navigation is pervasive throughout the website.
                        </p>
                        <p>Rather than just the University logo, we aimed to make the entirety of the main navigation reliable, recognizable, and straightforward.
                          We decided to include the four categories of About, Admissions, Academics, and Research after our competitive analysis revealed the commonality of the these four categories across multiple websites.
                          They are also broad categories that capture a wide range of different subcategories.
                          The same can be said about our decisions for the user type links.
                          We found that these labels are found across many university websites and touch upon the most common users of a university website.
                        </p>
                        <p>Beyond the navigation, we also decided to include a News and Events section on the homepage as they are important in showcasing achievements and accomplishments.
                          Again, we also found that these were common categories featured on the homepages of most university websites, including Leicesterâ€™s website.
                          In our design, we separated the news from the events as we thought that they were distinct enough to warrant confusion if they are grouped.
                          For the footer, we opted to keep it simple and moved links that we believed had more significance to the main navigation banner.
                          Overall, we tried for a more modern look with more emphasis on navigation.
