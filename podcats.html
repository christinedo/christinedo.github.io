                    This project was centered around the theme &quot;How Can We Become Better Students?&quot;. Together with my team members, we decided to address the issue of how students can quickly and easily capture all the important points of a lecture. Our solution was to build an application that allows students to add quick notes and tags to certain points of a live lecture and sync those notes to appropriate time stamps of that lecture’s podcast.

                    <p>
                        First, we needed to isolate a problem existing in this space. In order to do so, we observed students in order to understand their goals, values, and come up with design insights. I went about needfinding in the lecture hall, where I observed three students during a class lecture. My observations included note-taking methodologies and habits, when students get distracted, and when they decide to pay attention again. From my observations, I asked follow-up questions to my participants and then delved into isolating user needs. Afterwards, we reconvened as a team to share our observations and agree on the issue to tackle.

                    <p>
                        Together, we decided to address the issue of how traditional notes can lack context and finding a specific sound bite in a podcast is difficult. Our solution would focus on finding a way to, with little effort, create a custom podcast for yourself while listening to the lecture.

                        After storyboarding our concept, we moved on to parallel prototyping. We created two early versions of our application with paper prototypes in order to concentrate on high level concepts like how the app would flow and be used before investing time in finer details. Having more than one paper prototype allowed us to get better feedback about our approach to the problem.

                    <h4 class="text-center">Heuristic Evaluation</h4> 
                    <p>
                        In order to iterate on our designs, we conducted walkthroughs of our paper prototypes. We had our evaluators evaluate our prototypes on the basis of <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Nielsen's 10 Heuristics</a>.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Receiving feedback from real users early on in the design process allowed us see flaws in each prototype that we didn't see before. This gave us better insight into the pros and cons of each prototype and guided our choice to take the design of the second prototype forward, while integrating what worked from the first prototype into the second prototype.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Overall, this has allowed us to take a step back and re-evaluate how and if our designs help or hinder our goals for how students will use the application to learn and take notes.

                    <p>
                        Implementation began after our heuristic evaluation. Before making the app “pretty”, we wanted to make sure that basic functionalities were working in order to focus on user testing. The backend of this application was built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Although I’m more familiar with being the designer, it was fun and interesting to take on a role working on the server-side of an application, an aspect that I don’t normally get to work much with.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        As we developed our idea and built the app, sharing our progress and introducing user testing at every stage allowed us to understand whether or not our design decisions were inline with our goals for improving the the note taking experience and ultimately, the goal of leading the user to becoming a better student.

                    <h4 class="text-center">User Testing</h4> 
                    <p>
                        In terms of user testing, we conducted in-person tests with two students, as well as online A/B testing with 20 students. At this point, we had a working prototype so we could give users something tangible to use, while observing their interactions with the app.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <h4 class="text-light sub-heading">In-Person Tests</h4> With our in-person tests, we were curious as to how easily users could select the live lecture, add, edit, and delete a comment, and generally, navigate around the app. Overall, the biggest surprises came from the different affordances between web and mobile. Though we were developing the app on a computer, the app was meant to be used on a mobile device and as such, we tested the app on the user's mobile phone. As a result, we found that there were differences in how the app behaved and looked. While the size of the edit and delete icons were large enough when we resized the browser on the computer, they rendered too small on a mobile phone.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Beyond how the app behaved on a mobile phone, we found that users interacted with the app differently since using a phone afforded different ways to perform the same action on a computer. For example, using the enter key to submit on a phone is a more common practice that clicking a button to submit. We had not taken that into consideration when we were using the app on the computer and as such, our users, who were expecting the enter key to submit their changes, were initially confused as to why it wouldn't work.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In-person testing validated some design choices, while also pointing out design flaws. While it was easy for users to understand which lecture was live and navigate through the app, certain design choices, like the choice of words for a label were hard to understand.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <h4 class="text-light sub-heading">A/B Testing</h4> Our online A/B test was centered around how users prefer to mark a point of interest at during a lecture. Version A, the original version, allowed users to only leave comments. Version B, the experimental version, let users add tags and/or comments. By observing the number of bookmarks, edits, and deletes The overall result appears to indicate that version B, the version with tags, better guided the user into knowing what the structure of the application is and how it should be used.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The qualitative analysis showed that version A users were using the application as just another form of taking notes. The comments of the version A bookmarks closely resembled text that you would continuously jot down on a notebook; this is not what we were aiming for in the design and use of the application. Version B users, on the other hand, had bookmarks with comments that were more used as titles of the tagged interval. This more so actually represented the "bookmark" concept we had envisioned from the get go. Therefore, the qualitative analysis seemed to indicate that version B was better in guiding the user toward the overarching function of our application PodCats.

                        Unfortunately, moving forward with the application involves getting permission from our university to get access to the podcasts. While we would’ve loved to continue working on the project, we were not able to continue. Given more time and access, we would’ve loved to expand the functionality of the application and continue with more testing and iteration.

                        We wanted users to use PodCats as a way to mark a segment with a general topic of interest, rather than using it as a replacement note-taking tool. To accomplish this, we implemented general topic tags and a character limit. While these features had that goal in mind, there wasn't enough time to spend to ensure that users would understand and use those features with that intent.

                    <p>
                        In implementing the tags later in the process, we didn't get a chance to test how well the tags were doing, namely which tags were used most, hardly, or not at all and how we could improve the types of tags that were offered. Gaining insight into which tags students found most and least useful, as well as learning what types of tags users would find most useful would've better indicated to us if we were making the right design choices for that feature.

                        The same can be about the decision to add the character limit. While we knew how it was intended, we didn't have the time to observe and test if users understood the the purpose of the character limit was to discourage them from writing long, note-like comments and as such, it was difficult to see if that feature accomplished its goal. How it could've been improved or changed in order to do so more effectively would be a future consideration.
