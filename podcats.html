                        <p>This project was centered around the theme “How Can We Become Better Students?”
                          Together with my team members, we decided to address the issue of how students can quickly and easily capture all the important details of lecture.
                          We did so by building an application that allows students to add quick notes and tags to certain points of a live lecture and sync those notes to appropriate time stamps of that lecture’s podcast.</p>

                        <p>First, we needed to isolate a problem existing in this space.
                          In order to do so, we observed students in order to understand their goals, values, and come up with design insights.
                          I went about needfinding in the lecture hall, where I observed three students during a class lecture.
                          My observations included note-taking methodologies and habits, when students get distracted, and when they decide to pay attention again.
                          From my observations, I asked follow-up questions to my participants and then delved into isolating user needs.
                          Afterwards, we reconvened as a team to share our observations and agree on the issue to tackle.

                      <p>After feedback and careful consideration, we made some changes to the design and layout of the website.
                        One of the most significant and noticeable changes was our decision to combine all subpages under a category into one page.
                        That is, we combined all the subpages under "About" into one page, and all the subpages under "Menu" into one menu.</p>
                      <p>We noted that combining the About pages into one page would make the page quite long.
                        That meant that the current style of the navigation bar (static, with a tall height) also had to change.
                        I was tasked with creating mockups for the pages in the website, as well as figuring out the design of the new About page, Menu page, and navigation bar.</p>
                      <p>Initially, we were worried about lengthy submissions which would disengage the audience.
                        Our solution to this potential issue was to institute a 250 character limit on the length of the stories users can submit.
                        In this way, we can ensure some limitations on length while also encouraging users to concisely articulate their thoughts and opinions.</p>

                      <p>In the interim period between the mockups and the implementation of the final prototype, we went through a many design changes and tweaks.
                      Albeit small in nature, they made a noticeable difference.</p>
                      <p>The Google Map had long been a placeholder as we reasoned that UCSD students, our target users, would not find it as helpful since Muir Woods is located directly on campus.
                      The initial idea was to create our own map—a simple graphic—that would use the surrounding buildings as local landmarks.
                      But since Muir Woods is located underneath another building, our graphical representations seemed too abstract.
                      In the end, we decided on a photo of the storefront, which we believed was the most informative when paired with the text directions on the right.</p>
                      <p>We also replaced placeholder images with photos that showed off the more humanistic aspects of Muir Woods and the day-to-day happenings at Muir Woods.
                      Whereas the original header image was more focused on the machine, we replaced it with a photo of a Muirista preparing a drink from the vantage point of an ordering customer.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, we couldn’t see this project into fruition.
                          Although we were working with our client to look into how we can make this website live, between working with UCSD's hosting services and maintaining the website, our client ultimately decided against having a website entirely.
                          It was really disappointing to hear that, but overall, I gained valuable experience and insight into working with a client by doing this project.</p>
                        <p>In terms of design, one of the biggest challenges we had was with the "Stories" feature. It was a feature that our client really wanted, but from our initial research, we were concerned about user engagement with the feature.
                          If this project were to continue, I would've liked to spend more time researching the potential success of this feature (Who would or wouldn't use it? Why or why not?) and potential ways to encourage and incentivize its use.</p>
                        <p>In reflection, I also would’ve liked to devote more time developing the brand further by using more graphics, photos, and animations/interactive effects to improve the overall flow of the website. There had to be a lot of compromise between our goals and the clients and so I would like to explore, develop, and refine the aesthetics (perhaps revisiting chalkboard influences) and on the development side, optimize the website to be responsive.</p>
