                        <p>This project was centered around the theme “How Can We Become Better Students?”
                          Together with my team members, we decided to address the issue of how students can quickly and easily capture all the important details of lecture.
                          We did so by building an application that allows students to add quick notes and tags to certain points of a live lecture and sync those notes to appropriate time stamps of that lecture’s podcast.</p>

                        <p>First, we needed to isolate a problem existing in this space.
                          In order to do so, we observed students in order to understand their goals, values, and come up with design insights.
                          I went about needfinding in the lecture hall, where I observed three students during a class lecture.
                          My observations included note-taking methodologies and habits, when students get distracted, and when they decide to pay attention again.
                          From my observations, I asked follow-up questions to my participants and then delved into isolating user needs.
                          Afterwards, we reconvened as a team to share our observations and agree on the issue to tackle.

                        The backend of this application was built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
                        Although I’m more familiar with being the designer, it was fun and interesting to take on a role working on the server-side of an application,
                        an aspect that I don’t normally get to interface much with.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, moving forward with the application involves getting permission from our university to get access to the podcasts.
                           While we would’ve loved to continue working on the project, we were not able to continue.
                           Given more time and access, we would’ve loved to expand the functionality of the application and continue with more testing and iteration.
                        </p>
                        <p>A counterpart of our application was a “professor version” that controlled the start and stop of podcast recordings.
                           We got as far as implementing that functionality, but ideally that aspect of the application would’ve been expanded to involve statistics that the professor can view regarding metrics like where students are placing bookmarks and what tags students are using.
                           We wanted to expand PodCats beyond the student population and allow for it to inform and give feedback to professors too.</p>
